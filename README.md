# hello-world

I am the bone of my script
<br>Html is my body and css is my blood
<br>I have created over a thousand tags
<br>Unknown to crash
<br>Nor known to load
<br>Have withstood typos to create many links
<br>Yet those scripts will never do anything
<br>So, as I commit, Unlimited Branch Works

<br>The Idea
<br>Step 1. Create a Repository
<br>Step 2. Create a Branch
<br>Step 3. Make and commit changes
<br>Step 4. Open a Pull Request
<br>Step 5. Merge your Pull Request
<br>It's that simple!
